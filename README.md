Hi friends, I need your help! I'm currently doing research and writing a paper on a new way to discourage advertisers from using targeted advertisements. Basically, If we could all swap digital identities enough we could decrease the value in tracking us.

I've developed a chrome extension that does just that - swaps cookies on your browser so that you see ads meant for other people. I would love if some people wouldn't mind downloading the extension and letting it run (without adblock enabled) as you browse.
