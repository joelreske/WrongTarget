# Overview

WrongTarget was built as a proof-of-concept for the idea presented in
_WrongTarget: in reaction to a invasive ad tracking_, a paper written
for _Comp-116 - Security_ at Tufts University. The basic idea is that
if we all switch ad tracking cookies, targeted ads will be served to
the wrong people, decreasing their value.

# How to run

Simply download the source, go to the extension manager in Chrome, enable developer mode, click 'Open Unpacked Extension', and select the src folder.

# Future Plans

1.  Add to the list of known tracking cookies
2.  Potentially detect tracking cookie using a system similar to the one used by [PrivacyBarger](www.eff.org/privacybadger)
3.  Redesign cookie sharing to further obfuscate original cookie source
4.  Rigorous testing to show value.

Once these are done, this extension will be released on the Chrome Extension store.
